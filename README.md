# Advent-of-Code

ðŸŽ„ My solutions for Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com)

This repo is using [cargo-aoc](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc). Install
it and run `cargo aoc input` to download the puzzle inputs. Now you may start
`cargo run` in a year's directory to run all solutions of that year.
